<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my attempt at a technical assessment order to gain skills in:
* Angular CLI projects using typescript
* Routing with typescript
* State management with NGrX
* API calls with Node.js and express
* Connecting MongoDB database to the application


<br>

>**The application is a platform to act as a type of school database interface which displays a table of students and subjects which the user can view and make changes to. Functionality and conventions are still being added for some REST functions** 

<br>

### Built With

* Typescript
* Express
* Javascript
* CSS
* HTML
* Node.js
* NgRX/NxJS


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites and Installation

* Download nodejs
* Use npm to install correct versions of:
    - nodemon
    - mongoose
    - angular
    - typescript
* Ensure versions of your software align with those detailed in the package.json file


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Get the backend server running on local:3000 by going to the command line in your terminal and typing:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    This is equivalent to running nodemon api/server.js or node api/server.js. A successful connection will output 
    ```
    Example app listening at http://localhost:3000
    ```

2. Create a **new terminal**. This will host the frontend server and open the Angular application. Type in:
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
    This is equivalent to running ng serve and will open a new window in your browser with the app hosted on localhost:4200. If this doesn't happen automatically, type localhost:4200 into your browser to connect.

3. Make use of the interface buttons or endpoints to navigate the app.
