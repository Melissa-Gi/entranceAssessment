<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my attempt at the technical assessmentin order to gain skills in:
* Angular CLI projects using typescript
* Routing with typescript
* State management with NGrX
* API calls with Node.js and express
* Connecting MongoDB database to the application


<br>

>**I was only able to perfect DB connection and angular components and implement structures for routing. The application envokes a call stack logic error which was difficult to debug and so the interface will regrettably not run or display in the web browser as of now** 

<br>

### Built With

* Typescript
* CSS
* HTML
* Node.js
* VS code
